# monthly-zine

Hi!

This is a project primarily to learn how to build websites again, with focus on adopting modern practices, writing highly performant code, and trying
techniques that reduce energy consumption on server, in transit, and at rest.

I used to write HTML and CSS in the pre-Web 2.0 days and I loved it, even if I wasn't very good at it. When Javascript jumped on, I hopped off.
This is my attempt to catch up on 15 years of change while trying to contribute to the ever-evolving conversation on the ethical and environmental impact of tech.

I'm a UX Designer by trade. Give me critical feedback. Tell me what is or isn't working. Prepare for 1,000 bad sites before I publish 1 decent one.

Let's see how this goes.
