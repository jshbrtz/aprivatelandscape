# monthly-zine

Hi!

This is a project primarily to learn how to build websites, with focus on writing highly performant code and techniques that reduce energy consumption.

I used to write HTML and CSS in the pre-Web 2.0 days, though I wasn't good at it. When Javascript jumped on, I hopped off.
This is my attempt to catch up on 15 years of change while trying to contribute to the ever-evolving conversation on the ethical and environmental impact of tech. And maybe have a sense of humor.

I'm a UX Designer by trade. Give me critical feedback. Prepare for 1,000 bad sites before I publish 1 decent one.

Let's see how this goes.
